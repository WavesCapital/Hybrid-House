The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Hybrid House application from an MVP to a more feature-rich product. The work began with critical debugging of webhooks and the implementation of a score results page. A significant portion of the effort involved enhancing the UI/UX of the interview flow and migrating to OpenAI Responses API with prompt IDs. A recurring challenge was the Profile Page, which required extensive debugging, removal of JWT for public access, and database schema optimization to log individual athlete profile fields.

A major focus was fixing the Save Changes button on the user profile editing section, which led to deep dives into authentication state management and backend upsert logic. This evolved into a complete overhaul of the profile editing experience, introducing inline editing with auto-save. Subsequent work concentrated on refining the Generate New Profile form, including intelligent pre-population from historical data. The most recent and extensive task was a comprehensive redesign of the Athlete Profile page into a neon-noir performance cockpit, implemented in two major iterations (Iteration 2 and 5), focusing on visual polish, data presentation, and maintaining existing functionality. The engineer consistently used testing agents and troubleshoot agent for debugging, demonstrating a systematic approach to problem-solving.

The Hybrid House application provides an Athlete Profile assessment via a chat-style Interview Flow using OpenAI. Key features include a 55-question Full Interview and an 11-question Hybrid Interview (), both supporting a modern dark mode UI, progress bars, sharing features, and a Neo Design System. Data persistence is handled via Supabase, with interview data auto-saving and triggering score computation, followed by redirection to a dedicated score page. UI refinements included removing timestamps, improving text input, and adding a Coach is thinking message. A Profile Page was developed for users to view, edit, and regenerate past assessment scores. Recent requirements expanded to allow public access to profiles (removing JWT), optimize database logging by storing individual athlete fields alongside JSON blobs, and implement a comprehensive user profile system with avatar upload, ensuring athlete profiles are automatically linked to signed-in users. More recently, the profile page was redesigned with inline editing, auto-save, intelligent pre-population of athlete stats, and a neon-noir aesthetic, including a Hybrid Score Dial, Score Trend Chart, and a detailed Score Archive table.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deeply involved in implementing Iteration 5 of the Athlete Profile Page â€” Redesign Brief, which is a significant UI/UX overhaul. The last sequence of actions involved making JSON-aware changes to the Profile Page to enhance data presentation and visual layout, specifically:

1.  **Latest Hybrid Score Card**: Updating the dial label to  / 100, rounding the , and adding a new 6-item **Sub-Score grid** (Strength, Speed, VOâ‚‚ Max, Distance, Volume, Recovery). Each sub-score is displayed as a whole-number badge with a tiny neon progress bar and a tooltip.
2.  **Hybrid Score Trend Chart**: Modifying the chart to plot *only* the rounded  over time, with a Y-axis from 0-100 in 10-point steps, and data points displayed as glowing dots with detailed hover tooltips.
3.  **Score Archive Table**: This was the most recent complex task. The engineer was updating the table to include a comprehensive set of 19 columns: Date, Hybrid, Str, Spd, VOâ‚‚, Dist, Vol, Rec, BW (lb), VOâ‚‚-max, Mile PR, Long Run (mi), Wk Miles, HRV (ms), RHR (bpm), Bench 1RM, Squat 1RM, Deadlift 1RM, and Action. Specific formatting rules were being applied: all numeric cells are right-aligned and tabular,  displays as , and  or  values render as an em-dash (). Behavioral changes include a sticky header, sortability by Date & Hybrid, row hover effects, tinting of the most-recent row, and the View button transforming into an Eye icon.

The last completed action recorded was the edit to update the Score Archive table with the new column structure and the addition of the  icon import, followed by a frontend restart. The redesign is substantial, aiming for a neon-noir performance cockpit aesthetic, while strictly preserving all existing functionality and original IDs/event hooks. The work has progressed through multiple iterations, fixing rendering errors (like duplicate sections and direct object rendering) using the  and ensuring visual polish.

The next step is to restart the frontend and take a screenshot to verify the complete visual implementation of Iteration 5's design changes, particularly the updated Score Archive table and the new Sub-Score grid.
