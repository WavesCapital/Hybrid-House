The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on refining the Hybrid House application's UI/UX and addressing critical bug reports. Initially, the engineer tackled enhancements to the Share Score card, iterating through multiple design fixes to achieve a stunning, on-brand neon aesthetic, resolve text positioning, and fix image rendering issues. A major update involved dynamically displaying the user's  on the share card, which required synchronizing frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) data fetching to retrieve information from the  table. Subsequent efforts included correcting the order of content for native sharing (iMessage fix), restyling the Share Score button, and executing a comprehensive site-wide rebrand from Hybrid House to Hybrid Lab, alongside a URL correction from  to . The trajectory concluded with implementing a glowing effect for the Get Hybrid Score button on the home page, successfully enhancing its visual prominence.

The most recent development cycle added:
1.  **Share Card Enhancement**: Create an incredibly beautiful, on-brand, neon-themed share card (with circles and punchy copy) for the  page, ensuring text is below the image.
2.  **Share Card Personalization**: Replace HYBRID ATHLETE with the user's  from the  table, linked by .
3.  **Native Sharing Order**: Fix iMessage sharing to display the image before the text.
4.  **Share Score Button Styling**: Change the button to solid blue with a glow on hover instead of a gradient.
5.  **Application Rebranding**: Change all instances of Hybrid House to Hybrid Lab site-wide.
6.  **URL Correction**: Update all  URLs to .
7.  **Home Page Button Glow**: Make the Get Hybrid Score button on the home page glow.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the task of adding a constant glowing effect to the Get Hybrid Score button, located on the home page () within the  component.

This involved modifying the CSS properties associated with the  class to include:
-   A subtle, multi-layered cyan blue  to create a continuous glow when the button is at rest.
-   An enhanced, more intense  (using a 5-layer system) that activates on hover, providing a dynamic and visually striking effect.
-   Maintaining the existing  and  for smooth lift and animation on hover.

This enhancement ensures the primary Call-to-Action button now visually pops, aligning perfectly with the application's neon aesthetic and drawing user attention effectively. The changes were successfully applied and verified via a screenshot.

Preceding this, the engineer performed a comprehensive rebranding, changing all instances of Hybrid House to Hybrid Lab across the frontend (e.g., , , , , , , , , and  meta tags) and backend. Subsequently, all  URLs were corrected to . Significant work was also dedicated to revamping the Share Score card, including personalizing it with the  from the  table (requiring updates to  and ), fixing the image/text order for native sharing, and restyling the share button.
