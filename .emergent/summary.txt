The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Hybrid House application to a robust state, focusing on the Athlete Profile section. The work transitioned from initial debugging and basic feature implementation (webhooks, score page) to complex UI/UX overhauls, database schema enhancements, and authentication adjustments. Key iterative improvements included fixing the user profile editing, introducing inline editing with auto-save, intelligent pre-population of the Generate New Profile form, and a comprehensive neon-noir performance cockpit redesign. Recent efforts culminated in Iteration 6 fixes: refining the sub-score grid, score trend chart (later removed), and a detailed score archive table. A critical mid-task fix involved resolving a React object rendering error and fully decoupling the Profile Page from authentication. The final major task initiated was transforming the main score display and sub-score grid into an Iron-Man HUD style radar cluster, which is currently undergoing refinement based on user feedback regarding sizing and proportions. The engineer consistently utilized testing and troubleshooting agents for systematic problem-solving and verification.

The Hybrid House application offers an Athlete Profile assessment via an AI-powered chat Interview Flow. Initially, it provided a 55-question Full Interview and an 11-question Hybrid Interview with a dark mode UI, progress bars, and sharing features, persisting data via Supabase and redirecting to a score page. Recent developments involved refining the UI/UX of the interview flow, migrating to OpenAI Responses API with prompt IDs, and enhancing the Profile Page. This page was expanded to allow public access (removing JWT), optimize database logging by storing individual athlete fields, and implement a user profile system with avatar uploads, linking athlete profiles to users. The profile page underwent a major neon-noir aesthetic redesign (Iterations 2 & 5), incorporating inline editing, auto-save, intelligent pre-population of athlete stats for new profile generation, a Hybrid Score Dial, Score Trend Chart (later removed), and a detailed Score Archive table. The latest iteration (Iteration 6) focused on visual polish, data accuracy, filtering logic for charts and tables, and ensuring functional consistency. The most recent request is to transform the main score display into an Iron-Man HUD style radar cluster.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing and refining the Iron-Man HUD style radar cluster for the Latest Hybrid Score Card section on the Profile Page. The goal is to replace the current circular grid with one large central hybrid dial surrounded by six mini dials in a perfect hexagon, mimicking a futuristic heads-up display.

The initial implementation successfully created the basic hexagonal layout with gradient rings, correct positioning, and labels. However, the user provided direct feedback that the Circles are way too close and too small. Make everything the right side. make the outside circles big enough to have the score label in the circle. Make the proportions perfect for optimal ui/ux.

The engineer's last action involved addressing this feedback by:
1.  Adjusting the sizing and proportions of both the central and mini dials. The central dial was made larger (e.g., 160px diameter with a 10px stroke), and the mini dials were also increased in size (e.g., to 80px diameter).
2.  Improving the spacing between the circles to alleviate the cramped appearance.
3.  Modifying the HTML structure and CSS to move the score labels *inside* their respective circular progress bars for the mini dials, as requested by the user for better UI/UX.

The work is focused on achieving the specified visual aesthetic, maintaining existing IDs and data bindings, and ensuring proper responsiveness for different screen sizes, as defined in the Radar Cluster prompt (Chat Message 254). A screenshot was taken after the latest changes to verify the improved sizing and layout (Chat Message 272).

<optional_next_step>
I will continue refining the Iron-Man HUD radar cluster's UI/UX to perfect the proportions and ensure optimal visual appeal and usability, especially for the score labels inside the mini circles.
