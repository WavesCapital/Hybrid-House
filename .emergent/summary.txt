The AI engineer has successfully navigated a complex development trajectory for the Hybrid House application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more robust and feature-rich platform. Initial efforts established core functionalities like authentication, user profiles with privacy settings, and a leaderboard. Significant work then focused on enhancing the user profile with new fields (DOB, Country) and implementing a critical auto-save feature. The bulk of recent efforts involved a multi-phase enhancement of the  page, including advanced filtering (age, gender, country), UI improvements (display name source, removing tags/lines, column alignment, score tooltips), and resolving critical data integrity issues. A key challenge involved fixing the  linking between  and , which caused incorrect data display and orphaned profiles, necessitating a targeted database migration. UI inconsistencies and redirect bugs were also systematically addressed, demonstrating an iterative debugging approach.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved several critical issues related to the leaderboard and general UI. The primary focus was on ensuring accurate data display and proper linking between database tables.

Key resolved issues include:
1.  **Nick Bare's Visibility and Data Integrity**: Initially, Nick Bare's profile was not appearing or displayed incomplete information on the leaderboard. The root cause was identified as a systemic issue where  were not correctly linked to  via the  column ( for all existing profiles).
    *   **Fixes Applied**: A  script was developed and executed to update existing  by populating their  from matching . The  was then heavily modified to use the correct  join logic, ensuring , , , and  are correctly fetched from .
2.  **Leaderboard Deduplication**: The leaderboard was showing multiple entries for the same user (e.g., Kyle S appearing three times).
    *   **Fix Applied**: The  was updated to include deduplication logic, ensuring only the highest score for each unique  is displayed on the leaderboard.
3.  **Frontend Filter Null Handling**: The leaderboard filters (age, gender, country) were excluding athletes whose demographic data was , leading to a No athletes match message even when data existed.
    *   **Fix Applied**: The frontend filtering logic in  was enhanced to correctly handle  or  values for age, gender, and country, allowing profiles with incomplete demographic data to still appear when filters are set to All.
4.  **Header Cleanup**: The user requested to remove the email address and Welcome, username text from the application headers.
    *   **Fix Applied**: The  and  components were modified to remove these elements from their respective headers, resulting in a cleaner and more professional appearance.

All these issues have been verified as completely resolved, with the leaderboard now accurately displaying unique athletes, their highest scores, and complete demographic data sourced correctly.
