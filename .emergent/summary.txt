The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Hybrid Lab application from an MVP to a mature product, focusing heavily on the Hybrid Card Studio at . Initial efforts included comprehensive UI/UX redesigns, branding updates, and critical bug fixes, especially around the Calculate Hybrid Score button's data persistence.

The core of the work revolved around building the Hybrid Card Studio. This involved establishing new backend APIs for PR data, and an elaborate frontend for a Canva-style design canvas within an iPhone mockup. Key challenges included implementing robust drag-and-drop, dynamic resizing using , and ensuring accurate visual representation. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, iteratively refining component appearance, layout, and functionality, from fixing scroll overflows and perfecting circular resize handles to eliminating unwanted glow effects. Most recently, the focus shifted to introducing new component variants like the horizontal PRs and an advanced glowing dial, followed by a new feature request to add a PRs section to the user profile page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a new feature request from the user: add a PRs section to /profile that has all the PRs that we use and updates the database when changed. Should show the current value we have for the athlete.

This work initiated after extensive development and refinement of the Hybrid Card Studio () and ensuring visual consistency across the application's dials. The engineer successfully completed several intricate UI/UX improvements including:
*   Making the backgrounds and components sections of the Hybrid Card Studio scrollable, resolving overflow issues.
*   Implementing click-off deselection for components on the canvas.
*   Creating and perfecting Canva-style circular resize handles for selected components.
*   Refining the Strength PRs component to be a transparent MAXES display, removing extraneous data and backgrounds.
*   Transforming the Running PRs component into a transparent TIMES display, without per-mile pace.
*   Updating the original Hybrid Score Dial to a solid neon blue.
*   A comprehensive audit and removal of blue glow effects from all components except the Hybrid Score Dial (both versions), to achieve a flat design.
*   Fixing the background selection styling to show a single, clean border instead of a double box.
*   Creating a Hybrid Score Dial 2 with a futuristic, segmented, and refined glowing design, including subtle animations and text effects.
*   Ensuring the main Hybrid Score dial text on the home page () and results page () matched the precise styling (white color, no glow for number, uppercase, wider tracking, medium font weight, subtle glow for HYBRID SCORE label) of the new Hybrid Score Dial 2.
*   Adding the functionality to upload custom background images to the Hybrid Card Studio, including image validation, file size limits, and a delete option for uploaded backgrounds.

The current activity involves exploring the  file to determine the optimal location and approach for adding the new PRs section. The engineer is in the process of understanding the existing JSX structure and data flow of the profile page to integrate the new feature seamlessly.
