The previous AI engineer focused on building out the Hybrid House application, initially creating a full-length Interview Flow with OpenAI integration and Supabase persistence. A major challenge involved ensuring OpenAI's response format (single message, correct persona, JSON output) and debugging timestamp/duplicate message issues. The work then shifted to creating a new, shorter Hybrid Interview flow. Significant efforts were made to align its functionality with the existing full interview, including routing, backend endpoints, and frontend UI. Repeated issues arose with the webhook integration, specifically the payload format, deliverable type (score vs. hybrid-score), and preventing duplicate calls. The engineer iteratively debugged backend responses, frontend data handling, and even environment-specific problems like file watcher limits. The final reported issue is the webhook still sending an incorrect body with hybrid-score deliverable, despite extensive fixes, leading the engineer to suspect a persistent backend misconfiguration or user access to the wrong flow.

The Hybrid House application aims to provide an Athlete Profile assessment. Initially, this involved text-pasting for score computation via a webhook. UI/UX requirements included a modern dark mode, progress bars, share functionality, and a Neo Design System. The application shifted to Supabase for user accounts and data persistence. The core feature is now a chat-style Interview Flow for collecting athlete data, integrating with OpenAI, auto-saving to Supabase, generating clean JSON, and triggering score computation. This interview was initially designed for 48 (later 55) questions, with progress bars, suggested responses, branching logic, gamification (confetti, streak tracking), section recaps, dynamic prompts, and a precise JSON schema output. This flow is mandatory, replacing the old paste profile. Subsequently, a new, shorter Hybrid Interview flow was requested, accessible at , using a distinct Essential-Score Prompt v1.0 with 11 questions. This new flow should mirror the full interview's user experience, including a Start Interview button, and immediately display the computed score on the same page upon completion, triggered by a single, correctly formatted webhook call.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the primary focus was on debugging a persistent issue where the webhook triggered by the hybrid interview completion was still sending an incorrect body and  type. Specifically, the webhook body contained a message string (Thanks, Kyle! Your hybrid score essentials are complete...) instead of the expected athlete profile JSON, and the  was hybrid-score instead of score.

The AI engineer's actions leading up to this point involved:
1.  **Backend Response Refinement**: The backend's completion handlers (both normal and force completion in ) were modified to explicitly return the parsed athlete profile JSON () alongside the completion message. This was done to ensure the frontend had the correct data for the webhook.
2.  **Frontend Webhook Payload**:  was updated to send this  as the  in the webhook body, ensuring the correct JSON structure. The  was also explicitly set to .
3.  **Removal of Backend Webhook Calls**: Extensive efforts were made to remove all instances where the backend was triggering the webhook (), for both full and hybrid interview completion paths in , to eliminate duplicate webhook calls and ensure the frontend was the sole trigger.

Despite these changes, the user reported the issue persisted. The engineer then re-checked the frontend code, which seemed correct. Subsequent debugging efforts focused on the possibility of a cached backend state or a latent backend webhook call. The  agent was invoked, which successfully identified and *fixed* a crucial bug: the backend's completion response for the hybrid interview was missing the  field, causing the frontend to fall back to sending the message string.

After this fix, manual webhook testing confirmed the correct payload and response. An end-to-end backend test also passed, validating the new data flow and absence of backend webhook calls. However, the user's *latest* report indicates the problem ( being a string,  being hybrid-score) is still occurring, suggesting another missed backend call or a routing issue leading to the wrong interview flow being triggered.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the webhook is still receiving the incorrect body and hybrid-score deliverable, potentially by checking if the user is consistently accessing the correct hybrid interview endpoint.
