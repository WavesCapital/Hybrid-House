The AI engineer successfully developed the Hybrid Lab application from an MVP to a feature-rich product. Initial efforts focused on comprehensive UI/UX improvements, branding updates, adding a Marathon PR field, and redesigning the Hybrid Score Form into a single-scroll page. A critical bug involving the Calculate Hybrid Score button failing to trigger webhooks and store data was meticulously debugged and resolved.

Subsequently, the main feature developed was the Hybrid Card Studio (accessible at ). This involved establishing new backend APIs ( for GET/POST operations) and a complex frontend implementation. Key aspects included creating a Canva-style design canvas within a realistic iPhone Pro Max mockup, enabling drag-and-drop/click-to-add components with live user data previews, and implementing advanced resizing functionality. A significant challenge was ensuring true dynamic scaling of components rather than cropping, which was resolved using CSS . The latest work involved fixing a persistent visual bug where the page bottom randomly turned white.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a visual bug where the bottom of the Hybrid Card Studio page was randomly turning white. This issue occurred after the successful implementation and validation of several key features for the new  route:

1.  **Backend API Integration**: Successfully implemented and tested  and  in  to handle athlete Personal Record (PR) data, which is crucial for displaying real user data in the share cards.
2.  **Core Share Card Studio**: Developed the main  component, which serves as a Canva-style design environment.
3.  **Realistic iPhone Mockup**: Integrated a highly detailed iPhone Pro Max mockup as the visual canvas, featuring accurate dimensions, dynamic island, physical buttons, and a seamless appearance (after resolving initial visible border issues).
4.  **Interactive Components**: Implemented various draggable and selectable components (e.g., Hybrid Score Dial, PR Lifts/Runs, Score Chip, Nameplate) that populate with real user data. Initial bugs preventing component addition and drag-and-drop were resolved.
5.  **Canva-Style Resizing**: Added professional-grade 8-point resize handles with Hybrid Lab's neon branding. A critical bug, where resizing resulted in content cropping instead of true dynamic scaling, was addressed by adopting a CSS  approach, ensuring components maintain perfect proportions.
6.  **Keyboard Delete**: Enabled deletion of selected components using the Delete/Backspace keys for improved user workflow.

The last completed action was debugging and fixing the persistent white bottom page issue. This was identified as a background styling problem where certain containers lacked explicit dark background colors. The fix involved adding  and  classes to the main flex container, left sidebar, tab content areas, and canvas area in  to ensure consistent dark theming. The user confirmed the resizing functionality was working correctly before this final UI fix.
