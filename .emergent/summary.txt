<analysis>
The AI engineer has successfully advanced the Hybrid House application from an MVP state, integrating significant features and resolving critical bugs. Initial efforts established core functionalities like authentication, leaderboard display, privacy settings, and restored the OpenAI-powered interview system. Subsequent work focused heavily on UI/UX enhancements and robust data persistence. A major achievement was implementing comprehensive user profile management, including Date of Birth and Country fields. This led to resolving a complex session persistence bug on the profile page and then a multi-step debugging process to fix auto-save functionality for these new fields, culminating in a successful resolution for country data persistence. Currently, the engineer is focused on enhancing the  page by implementing advanced filtering options for age, gender, and country, as well as updating the SEX header to GENDER.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid House application is designed as an Athlete Profile assessment system, featuring an AI-powered Interview Flow. It evolved from a basic MVP, adopting an Iron-Man HUD inspired profile display and a consistent Laser Pop design system. The core objective is to deliver a seamless user experience with robust data control.

Key product requirements addressed through development:
1.  **Home Page & Interview Flow Access**: The landing page () is universally accessible. Unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-up to initiate the Hybrid Interview, then to  upon authentication.
2.  **Logout Functionality**: A dedicated  route was implemented for secure user sign-out.
3.  **Global Leaderboard**: A Hybrid Score leaderboard displays athletes' highest public scores, using  and maintaining the Laser Pop design.
4.  **Profile Privacy Controls**: The  page allows users to set athlete scores as public/private, persisting this in Supabase, with the leaderboard only displaying public profiles.
5.  **AI Interview Functionality Restoration**: The interview system uses the OpenAI Responses API () for dynamic conversations.
6.  **User Profile Enhancement**: Added Date of Birth and Country fields to the Edit Profile section, ensuring database updates. Age (calculated), country flag, and gender are to be displayed on the leaderboard.
7.  **Auto-Save Profile**: Implement auto-save with debouncing for profile edits, removing the manual Save Profile button.
8.  **Leaderboard Filtering**: Enhance the  table to allow filtering by age, gender, and country, and change the SEX header to GENDER.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend for API, DB, and OpenAI.
    -   **Changes**:  modified to retrieve and join  for  and , fixing  field names.  updated to include default .  added for privacy toggles.  and  confirmed.  and  filter for complete scores.  Pydantic model confirmed to include  and ;  was modified to convert empty string  to  to resolve database invalid input syntax errors. Backend testing agent also applied a database migration to add  column to  table.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines application routing.
    -   **Changes**:  adjusted. New routes  and  introduced. A new dedicated  route pointing to  was added.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays and allows editing of user/athlete profiles.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated Privacy toggles. Added delete X button for athlete profiles. Modified profile fetching for authenticated users. Added Date of Birth (date input) and Country (dropdown) fields to form state and JSX. Critical bug fix: conditional rendering changed from  to  to resolve authentication persistence issues. Implemented auto-save with debouncing for all profile fields (, , ), removed Save Profile button, and added a saving indicator. Added safe fallbacks for  and  input values to handle  or missing data during loading. Auto-save payload was temporarily modified to exclude , then re-included after database fix.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages user authentication state.
    -   **Changes**:  function used by  component; no direct code modifications within the trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Home page and AI interview interface.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored for conditional rendering.  updated.  fixed for OpenAI calls. A new header was added to the home page containing Log In and Sign Up buttons.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles user login and signup.
    -   **Changes**: Defaulted to signup, processes URL params, redirects to  after auth.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Newly created component for user logout.
    -   **Changes**: Calls  and redirects to home.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays ranked athlete scores.
    -   **Changes**: Developed to fetch/display public scores. Underwent significant redesign (Podium Spotlight, Minimal Aesthetic, Glassmorphism). Scores rounded. Currently being updated to display age, country flag, and gender (initial setup included headers and placeholders, backend join verified). The SEX header was changed to GENDER. New filter states (, ) and a  helper were added. The filter section was updated to include age range slider and country dropdown filters.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Newly created dedicated component for user login.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented to provide a focused login experience, separate from the combined AuthForm.
-   **Database Migration Scripts (e.g., )**:
    -   **Importance**: Scripts for updating Supabase schema.
    -   **Changes**:  added  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE to . The  column was added to  table via a SQL migration executed by the backend testing agent.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Script to populate sample data for testing.
    -   **Changes**: Adds 3 public athlete profiles with complete score data, correct column names, and valid UUIDs.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New script created to add  column to database.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the  page with improved filtering capabilities. The user explicitly requested to:
1.  Change the SEX header label to GENDER.
2.  Add filtering options for Age (using an age range slider).
3.  Add filtering options for Country (using a dropdown).
4.  Improve the existing gender filter and implement proper filtering logic for all three.

The AI engineer's current work involves:
-   **Frontend ():**
    -   Successfully changed the SEX header to GENDER.
    -   Added new React states for managing filter values (, ) and debouncing filter application (, ).
    -   Implemented a helper function  to dynamically extract country options from the athlete data.
    -   Significantly updated the filter UI section within the  component, replacing the old structure with a new one that includes:
        -   An Age Range slider.
        -   A Country dropdown filter.
        -   Improved gender filter UI.
    -   The integration of these new filter components into the leaderboard's rendering logic has been completed.

The work is currently focused on the frontend implementation of these filters. The next immediate step is to ensure these newly added filters are functional and apply the filtering logic to the displayed data, then test them thoroughly.
