The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the Hybrid House application from an MVP to a refined product, primarily focusing on the Athlete Profile and later the Hybrid Interview Flow sections. Initial work involved UI/UX overhauls, database schema enhancements, and authentication adjustments. Key design iterations included a neon-noir performance cockpit for the profile page, followed by an Iron-Man HUD radar cluster for score visualization. Iterative user feedback led to continuous refinements in layout, spacing, and two major color scheme changes (Electric Limeade to Laser Pop flat neon). The engineer also integrated a functional Edit Profile section, ensured robust authentication flow, and undertook a complete redesign of the home/landing page and the interview page to align with the new aesthetic. The trajectory highlights a methodical approach, utilizing testing agents for verification and addressing user feedback iteratively, demonstrating strong problem-solving in a complex React/FastAPI codebase with Supabase integration.

The Hybrid House application provides an Athlete Profile assessment through an AI-powered Interview Flow. It initially featured a 55-question Full Interview and an 11-question Hybrid Interview with dark mode UI. The application evolved to use OpenAI Responses API with prompt IDs, and the Profile Page was significantly enhanced for public access (removing JWT), optimized database logging for individual athlete fields, and introduced a user profile system with avatar uploads. The profile page underwent a neon-noir redesign, incorporating inline editing, auto-save, intelligent pre-population, a Hybrid Score Dial, Score Trend Chart (later removed), and a detailed Score Archive table. Recent focus included visual polish, data accuracy, and functional consistency. The Iron-Man HUD style radar cluster was implemented for the main score display. The current task is to ensure the Hybrid Score Landing Page (home page) matches the redesigned  page, and that its Start Hybrid Interview buttons correctly manage user authentication (redirecting to sign-up if not logged in, then to interview).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on ensuring a seamless user experience for the Hybrid Score Landing Page (home page) concerning authentication and navigation. The goal is for the landing page to always be the initial view, regardless of the user's logged-in status. If a user is not signed in and clicks the Start Hybrid Interview button, they should be redirected to the sign-up/sign-in page (with sign-up as default). Upon successful sign-up/login, they should then be smoothly redirected to the hybrid interview itself.

The engineer has already implemented the redesign of the landing page and the interview page to match the Laser Pop aesthetic. A critical step was fixing the conditional rendering logic within  (Chat Message 382, 383, 384, 385), which was incorrectly showing the landing page statically instead of conditionally switching to the interview interface based on the . This fix ensured that the Start Hybrid Interview buttons correctly trigger the interview flow when a session is active.

However, the specific requirement for handling unauthenticated users (redirect to sign-up, then to interview) is still being addressed. The last action indicates the engineer is modifying the main conditional logic to handle this authentication flow, ensuring the user is prompted to sign in/up before proceeding to the interview if they are not already authenticated.

<optional_next_step>
Modify the  function and its associated logic in  to implement the unauthenticated user flow for the Start Hybrid Interview button, redirecting to sign-up/login as needed.
