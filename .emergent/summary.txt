The previous AI engineer successfully established the Hybrid House application, transitioning from MongoDB to Supabase and implementing a core Interview Flow with OpenAI. The primary challenge during this trajectory was ensuring OpenAI's strict adherence to the provided system prompt, especially regarding question order, conversational tone (Kendall Toole persona), and output format (single message per turn, completion trigger). The engineer iteratively debugged issues like timestamp errors, duplicate assistant messages (both backend logic and frontend filtering), and incorrect question sequencing. A significant re-architecture was required for the system prompt itself, and the backend's handling of OpenAI's  array was a critical fix. The work also involved UI enhancements like confetti and streak tracking, and a final task was initiated to create a new, shorter Hybrid Interview flow, which is currently in progress.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid House application aims to provide an Athlete Profile assessment. Initially, this involved pasting text for score computation via a webhook. Key UI/UX requirements included a modern dark mode, progress bars, share functionality for score images, and adherence to a Neo Design System. A major architectural shift moved the application to Supabase for user accounts and data persistence. The current core feature is a chat-style Interview Flow designed to collect athlete profile data. This flow must integrate with OpenAI, auto-save to Supabase, generate a clean athlete profile JSON, and trigger score computation. Specific requirements for the interview include 48 (later 55) questions, progress bars, suggested responses (initially excluded, then reintroduced), branching logic, gamification (confetti, streak tracking), section recaps, dynamic prompts based on wearables, and a precise JSON schema output. This interview flow is mandatory, replacing the old paste profile method.

    - **Initial State**: Handled OpenAI integration (, ), n8n webhook, and cleaning messages. Used .
    - **Changes**: Updated to  model. The system prompt was extensively modified and updated multiple times to enforce a specific conversational style (Kendall Toole persona), single question per turn, and proper question ordering. Logic for detecting confetti milestones and streak tracking was added. The way OpenAI responses are processed was critically changed: initially  were only sent once (fixed), then  was used (aggregated multiple responses), and finally, it was changed to explicitly take only the *first* output message from OpenAI's  array to ensure single messages. New endpoints  and  were added for the shorter interview.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer was actively working on resolving the persistent issue of OpenAI's Responses API returning *multiple assistant messages* in a single turn, which caused a messy user experience (concatenated text, out-of-order questions).

The latest attempts involved:
1.  **Backend Fix**: The engineer identified that while  from OpenAI's Responses API aggregates all output items into one string, the API *itself* can legitimately return multiple  objects within its  array. The fix implemented in  was to explicitly take only the  content from the  (the very first output message), ignoring any subsequent output messages from OpenAI. This was done to force a single, primary response per turn from the backend.
2.  **Frontend Filtering (Prior Attempt)**: Earlier, a  function was implemented in  to filter out consecutive assistant messages on the client side, aiming to display only the first one. While this provided a safeguard, the root cause was still that the backend was receiving and concatenating multiple messages, which this latest backend fix addresses more directly.
3.  **Conversation State**: The engineer had temporarily disabled  (a key feature of Responses API for state management) due to perceived corruption, but then re-enabled it, realizing it was essential. The latest fix aims to work *with* the  and the API's design for stateful conversations.
4.  **New Feature Initiation**: Following the attempts to stabilize the full interview, the user requested a new, shorter interview. The engineer has begun implementing this by:
    *   Updating  to create a  route for the existing component and a  route for the new one.
    *   Creating  by copying .
    *   Adding new backend endpoints (, ) in  with a new, distinct Essential-Score Prompt v1.0 for OpenAI.

The system is currently in a state where the backend logic for handling single OpenAI responses (taking only the first output item) has been applied, and the scaffolding for the new Hybrid Interview is in place, with backend endpoints and a frontend component created. The last action was restarting the backend.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue adapting and implementing the logic within  and its corresponding backend endpoints to fully support the new Essential-Score Prompt v1.0 and then test this new interview flow.
