The AI engineer successfully progressed the Hybrid House application from an MVP, focusing on core functionality refinements and new feature integration. Initial work involved overhauling the authentication flow, addressing Supabase session persistence, and iterative UI/UX improvements following a Laser Pop aesthetic. Key features introduced included a logout route, a dynamic leaderboard, and detailed privacy settings for athlete profiles, which required complex database migrations. The critical OpenAI-driven interview system was restored, ensuring dynamic, contextual conversations. Subsequent work focused on extensive UI/UX redesigns for the leaderboard (Podium Spotlight, minimalistic cards) and implementing profile management features like athlete profile deletion, hybrid score filtering, and privacy toggle functionality. The current task involves enhancing user profiles with Date of Birth and Country fields and reflecting this data (age, gender, country flags) on the leaderboard.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid House application is an Athlete Profile assessment system featuring an AI-powered Interview Flow. It transitioned from a basic MVP to a refined product with an Iron-Man HUD inspired profile display and a consistent Laser Pop design system. The core problem involved ensuring seamless user experience and data control.

The specific product requirements addressed in the trajectory included:
1.  **Home Page & Interview Flow Access**: The landing page () must be universally accessible. Start Hybrid Interview should redirect unauthenticated users to sign-up, then to  upon authentication.
2.  **Logout Functionality**: Implement a dedicated  route for secure user sign-out.
3.  **Global Leaderboard**: Create a Hybrid Score leaderboard displaying athletes' highest scores using , maintaining the Laser Pop design.
4.  **Profile Privacy Controls**: On the  page, allow users to set athlete scores as public/private. This setting must persist in Supabase, and the leaderboard should only display public profiles.
5.  **AI Interview Functionality Restoration**: Restore the interview system to use the OpenAI Responses API with prompt ID  for dynamic conversations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a comprehensive update to the user profile and leaderboard functionality.

The user's explicit request (Chat Message 253) was to:
1.  Add a spot for Date of Birth and Country in the user's Edit Profile section on the  page.
2.  Ensure these new fields update the database user profile.
3.  Display the user's Age (calculated from Date of Birth) in the leaderboard.
4.  Display the Country Flag based on the selected country in the leaderboard.
5.  Display Gender in the leaderboard.

The AI engineer's current work involves addressing these points:
-   **Frontend ():**
    -   Modified the  state to include  and .
    -   Updated the  hook to correctly populate these new fields from fetched user data.
    -   Added JSX input elements for Date of Birth (using a date input) and Country into the Edit Profile section of the  component, specifically after the existing location field.
-   **Backend ():**
    -   Confirmed  already exists in the  Pydantic model.
    -   Added the  field to the  model to allow it to be updated via the API.
    -   Modified the  endpoint to perform a join operation with the  table. This allows fetching  and  associated with each .
-   **Leaderboard Display ():**
    -   The next immediate step is to integrate the fetched , , and  data into the  component. This involves:
        -   Adding a helper function to display country flags.
        -   Calculating and displaying age based on .
        -   Displaying the gender.

The work is currently focused on getting these new data points to display correctly on the leaderboard, with backend modifications already confirmed to fetch the necessary data. The frontend rendering of these new fields on the leaderboard is the ongoing task.
