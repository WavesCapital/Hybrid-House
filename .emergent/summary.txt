The AI engineer's work focused on enhancing the Hybrid Lab application. Initially, broad UI/UX improvements, branding updates, and the addition of a Marathon PR field were implemented, along with a significant redesign of the Hybrid Score Form into a unified, single-scroll page. A critical part of the trajectory involved extensive debugging and resolution of a major bug: the Calculate Hybrid Score button failing to trigger webhooks and store data. This was meticulously debugged, identifying issues with an empty webhook response, incorrect payload structure, and a crucial frontend error in extracting the profile ID from the backend response. Post-fix, the engineer implemented comprehensive form pre-filling from both user and athlete profiles and refined UI elements by updating placeholder values and removing extraneous text.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid Lab application (formerly Hybrid House) calculates a Hybrid Score (0-100) for athletes, offering recommendations. Key features include a homepage, authentication, leaderboard, and user profiles. Recent development phases, as reflected in this trajectory, addressed several product needs:
1.  **Share Card Refinement**: Displaying user  with correct native sharing order (image before text) and a neon theme.
2.  **Branding Consistency**: Site-wide rebrand from Hybrid House to Hybrid Lab and updating the domain to .
3.  **UI/UX Overhaul for Hybrid Score Form**: Redesigning the form into a single-scroll page, adding clear sections, pill-shaped UI elements, and constant neon glowing buttons. Integrating field explanations, device-specific how-to-find tips, and setting Optional labels to subtle gray italics.
4.  **App Selector Integration**: Adding dropdowns for running and strength apps with database persistence and specific orange tips for running apps.
5.  **Data Persistence**: Ensuring the Marathon PR field is correctly added and stored in the Supabase database upon form submission.
6.  **Design System Documentation**: Creating a comprehensive style guide and a  page showcasing brand elements, including neon score circles.
7.  **Critical Bug Resolution**: Fixing the Calculate Hybrid Score button, which was failing to send webhooks or store data, addressing issues related to webhook payload, profile ID extraction, and database schema compatibility.
8.  **Form Prefilling**: Automatically populating form fields for logged-in users with existing data from  and the highest hybrid score from .
9.  **UI/UX Polish**: Updating placeholder values with realistic numbers for an average hybrid athlete and removing unnecessary descriptive text under form fields like gender.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the  component. The primary work involved resolving a critical bug where the Calculate Hybrid Score button was not triggering the webhook or storing data correctly.

The debugging process involved:
1.  **Initial Diagnosis & Webhook Fix**: Correcting the webhook payload to ensure  and  were always present and that  values were omitted, based on user-provided example.
2.  **Comprehensive Debugging & Error Handling**: Adding extensive step-by-step console logging and  notifications throughout the  function in  to trace the execution flow and pinpoint errors. This included handling profile creation failures, missing profile IDs, webhook configuration issues, empty/invalid webhook responses, score data validation/storage failures, and network errors.
3.  **Syntax Corrections**: Addressing multiple ESLint parsing errors and structural issues in  identified during the logging enhancement process.
4.  **Profile ID Extraction Fix**: Resolving a critical issue where the frontend was attempting to extract the profile ID from  instead of the correct  for authenticated users. This fix allowed the end-to-end flow to complete successfully.

Following the bug fix, the work transitioned to feature enhancements for the :
1.  **Form Prefilling**: Implementing logic to automatically populate form fields for logged-in users. This involved fetching user data from the  table (personal info, basic metrics) and the highest scoring performance data from the  table (PRs, strength metrics).
2.  **Placeholder Values**: Updating all input field placeholders to display realistic numerical values representative of an average hybrid athlete, providing better guidance to users.
3.  **UI Text Removal**: Removing an explicit explanatory text previously present under the Gender field to streamline the UI.

The last completed action was the removal of the gender description text, and the user confirmed that the previous fixes and enhancements (like the button functionality and pre-filling) were working as expected.
