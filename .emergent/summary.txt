The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Hybrid House application through several complex phases. Initially, mobile responsiveness was a key focus, optimizing various frontend components like the home page, leaderboard, profile, and authentication forms. Following this, a public profile view feature was implemented, allowing users to view athlete profiles directly from the leaderboard. A critical bug related to incorrect API prefixes for this feature was identified and promptly resolved. The next major undertaking involved integrating a new webhook-based hybrid interview process, necessitating database schema updates for new fields (height, weight, wearables), robust backend webhook endpoints with Pydantic models, and frontend UI adjustments. The latest phase addressed database normalization by removing redundant personal data from  and consolidating it in . This led to the discovery of a widespread  issue in , which is the current, unresolved problem the engineer is attempting to fix to ensure correct data linking and display.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on a critical database normalization effort. The goal was to remove redundant personal information (like , , , , , , ) from the  table, ensuring this data is sourced solely from the  table, linked by the  column.

The work involved:
1.  **Auditing**: Identified redundant columns and existing data.
2.  **Planning**: Developed a multi-phase plan to migrate data, remove columns, and update application code.
3.  **Column Removal**: Successfully executed SQL commands (via Supabase Management API) to remove the specified redundant columns from .
4.  **Code Updates**: Began updating application code to reflect the normalized structure:
    *   Modified webhook processing in .
    *   Updated  to use proper joins with  for fetching demographic data.
    *   Updated the user profile endpoint ( in ) to work with the normalized structure.

However, during backend testing of the normalized system, a critical flaw was discovered: **all existing  records had their  column set to **. This breaks the intended foreign key relationship with , causing the normalized data retrieval (e.g., for the leaderboard) to fail. The AI engineer's immediate task before this summary was to address this  linking issue, attempting to update existing  to correctly point to their respective  records. Database constraints on field lengths continue to be a challenge in programmatically fixing these records.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to find a robust approach to fix the  linking for existing  records given the restrictive database constraints.
