The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the Hybrid House application, focusing on refining core functionalities and introducing new features. Initial efforts involved a comprehensive overhaul of the authentication flow, ensuring seamless transitions between landing, sign-up/login, and interview pages, despite recurring Supabase session persistence challenges. A significant part of the work involved iterative UI/UX improvements, adhering to a Laser Pop aesthetic across the application. New features such as a dedicated logout route, a fully functional leaderboard with dynamic ranking, and a detailed privacy settings system for athlete profiles were integrated. A major hurdle was the database migration for the privacy feature, which required multiple attempts due to Supabase's security constraints on schema changes via API, eventually resolved by finding the correct management API. The trajectory concluded with the critical restoration of the OpenAI-driven interview system, ensuring dynamic, contextual conversations, which had regressed to static content during earlier fixes.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid House application is an Athlete Profile assessment system featuring an AI-powered Interview Flow. It transitioned from a basic MVP to a refined product with an Iron-Man HUD inspired profile display and a consistent Laser Pop design system. The core problem involved ensuring seamless user experience and data control.

The specific product requirements addressed in the trajectory included:
1.  **Home Page & Interview Flow Access**: The landing page () must be universally accessible, regardless of login status. Clicking Start Hybrid Interview should redirect unauthenticated users to sign-up (default mode), followed by an automatic redirection to the  page upon successful authentication.
2.  **Logout Functionality**: Implement a dedicated  route for secure user sign-out, clearing session data.
3.  **Global Leaderboard**: Create a Hybrid Score leaderboard. It should display athletes' highest scores, using  for identification, and maintain the Laser Pop design theme.
4.  **Profile Privacy Controls**: On the  page, enable users to set their athlete scores as public or private. This setting must persist in the Supabase database, and the leaderboard should exclusively display public profiles.
5.  **AI Interview Functionality Restoration**: Restore the interview system to use the OpenAI Responses API with the specific prompt ID , ensuring dynamic and contextual conversations.

    -   **Changes**:
        -    was removed from the home () route, making the landing page always accessible.
        -   A new  was added for  to manage access to the interview flow.
        -   New routes for  (using ) and  (using ) were introduced.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays and allows editing of user and athlete profiles.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Integrated a Privacy column with interactive toggle switches for each athlete profile in the Hybrid Score History table, controlling  status.

        -   Implemented  function to send privacy status updates to the backend.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages user authentication state and provides sign-in/sign-out functionality.
    -   **Changes**: The  function was utilized by the new  component. No direct content modifications were made within the trajectory to the core  file.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the landing page and the interactive AI interview interface.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Refactored extensively to conditionally render either the landing page or the interview interface based on the URL path ( or ).
        -   The  function was updated to redirect unauthenticated users to  and authenticated users directly to .
        -   The  responsible for initializing the interview session was fixed to call the backend's OpenAI endpoint for dynamic content, removing a problematic demo session fallback.
        -   Loading state management for buttons was refined to prevent UI glitches.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the restoration and full integration of the OpenAI Responses API into the Hybrid Interview system. This addressed a critical user feedback point where the interview was not progressing dynamically with AI-generated content, but was stuck at a static welcome message or loading screen.

The primary issue was identified in , where the  responsible for initiating the interview session was creating a local, non-interactive demo session instead of properly calling the backend to fetch OpenAI-driven questions. Despite previous attempts to fix authentication persistence and button glitches, this core AI functionality had regressed.

The engineer's work involved:
1.  **Auditing Backend**: Confirmed that 's  and  endpoints were correctly configured to use the OpenAI Responses API with prompt ID .
2.  **Refactoring Frontend Interview Start**: Modified the  in  to ensure it consistently calls  on component mount. This function now correctly interacts with the backend to initiate a genuine OpenAI-powered conversation, fetch the first question, and manage the conversational state.
3.  **Ensuring Seamless Flow**: The  function was also verified to correctly transmit user responses to the backend for OpenAI processing, and to update the UI with AI responses and question progress.
4.  **Authentication Handling**: The fix ensures the system correctly distinguishes between authenticated users (who get the full AI interview experience) and handles unauthenticated access (e.g., redirecting to authentication or potentially offering a guided demo, although the trajectory confirms that login is now required for the AI-powered flow).

As a result, the interview system is now fully functional and dynamic. When a user logs in and navigates to , they are greeted by an AI-generated welcome message, followed by the first question from the OpenAI model. Subsequent interactions also drive the conversation forward dynamically, with progress correctly tracked. The Starting your interview stuck screen is resolved, and the user experience for the core assessment flow is seamless and as intended.
