The previous AI engineer's work on Hybrid House evolved from basic MVP features to a more complex, robust application. Initially, efforts focused on debugging a critical webhook issue and implementing a score results page with share functionality. Significant UI/UX enhancements were made to the interview flow. Key architectural changes involved migrating from basic chat prompts to OpenAI Responses API with prompt IDs for hybrid interviews. A major focus was the Profile Page, requiring extensive debugging and removal of JWT authentication for public access, followed by database schema optimization to log individual athlete profile fields. The most recent ongoing task revolved around fixing the Save Changes button on the user profile editing section, which was failing due to a lack of proper user authentication state handling and an upsert mechanism for new profiles.

The Hybrid House application aims to provide an Athlete Profile assessment using a chat-style Interview Flow powered by OpenAI. Initially, it involved a 55-question Full Interview and a later, shorter 11-question Hybrid Interview accessible via . Core requirements included a modern dark mode UI with progress bars, sharing features, and a Neo Design System. User authentication and data persistence were managed via Supabase, with interview data auto-saving and triggering score computation. Updates included redirecting to a new score page, refining UI (removing timestamps, Basic info, improving text input, sticky progress/textbox, Coach is thinking message), extending webhook timeout, and creating a Profile Page for users to view, edit, and regenerate past assessment scores. A recent emphasis was to allow public access to profiles (no token needed), optimize database logging by storing individual fields alongside JSON blobs, and implement a comprehensive user profile system with avatar upload and general profile editing, ensuring athlete profiles are automatically linked to signed-in users.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement suggested response buttons (chips) in the frontend for the interview flow.
-   Implement dynamic branching logic for questions based on user answers in the interview.
-   Implement dynamic  based on  answer for Q29.
-   Refine the full 55-question flow for completeness and accuracy.
-   Fix the Save Changes button on the Profile Page: The current issue is that changes are not persisting despite backend upsert functionality, indicating a frontend issue related to authentication context or API call triggers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was deep into debugging the Save Changes button functionality on the . The core problem was that when a user clicked Save Changes, the modifications were not being persisted, and the page would effectively refresh without reflecting the updates.

Initial diagnosis indicated potential issues with the backend's update logic, specifically for cases where a user profile might not exist on the first save. This led to the implementation of an upsert pattern in the backend ( endpoint in ) to create a new user profile if one doesn't exist, or update it if it does. Backend tests confirmed this upsert functionality was working correctly.

However, the frontend  was still exhibiting the problem. Debugging revealed critical issues with the user's authentication state within the frontend:
-   Console logs showed  and , indicating no authenticated user.
-   The user profile editing section on the  () was conditionally rendered based on the  object from the . When  was null, this section, including the Save Changes button, was not even visible.

A user-provided screenshot contradicted this, showing the profile section *was* visible. This led to further confusion, but subsequent debugging () confirmed that indeed,  and  were  during the test, preventing the  function from executing correctly and saving changes.

The current state is that the backend upsert for user profiles is verified, but the frontend's save button functionality is broken because the component expects an authenticated user to perform the update, and the authentication context isn't consistently available or properly handled for this specific interaction. The AI engineer was last attempting to re-verify authentication functionality.
