<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Hybrid House application from concept to a functional MVP. The development followed an iterative approach, initially building a React frontend with a FastAPI backend and external webhook integration. Key phases included establishing UI/UX, handling complex webhook responses, implementing data display, adding a sharing feature, and a complete design overhaul to the Neo Design System. A significant architectural shift occurred from MongoDB to a pure Supabase setup for both authentication and data persistence, streamlining the backend. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving, particularly in debugging JSX errors and adapting to evolving requirements, culminating in a visually polished and authenticated application ready for the next major feature.

<product_requirements>
The Hybrid House application was initially designed to provide an Athlete Profile assessment. Users paste their profile text into an input field, which triggers a POST request to an external webhook () with the  content. The UI was required to display the response in a beautiful, modern dark mode UI inspired by Ultrahuman Ring.

Subsequent requirements included:
- Handling three separate webhook calls for , ,  deliverables.
- Robust timeout handling (up to 4 minutes) with dynamic progress bars and checkmark animations.
- Displaying scores rounded to whole numbers and converting metrics (body weight, mile time, strength) to imperial units.
- Simplifying the initial display to focus on Hybrid Athlete Score, with plans accessible via separate buttons.
- A Share button to generate an image of key scores () with social media sharing options.
- A complete site redesign to the Neo Design System (Matrix-meets-Vercel aesthetic), encompassing specific color palettes (bright blue primary), typography, spacing, motion, and glasmorphic component styling.
- Integration of user accounts and data persistence using Supabase, with a refactor to a pure Supabase architecture (replacing MongoDB).
- Beautifully designed login/signup pages consistent with the Neo Design System.
- The latest request is to integrate a chat-style Interview Flow for collecting athlete profile data, streaming from OpenAI, auto-saving to Supabase, and triggering score computation via an edge function.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a comprehensive refactor of the Hybrid House application to utilize a **pure Supabase architecture**, moving entirely away from MongoDB. This involved a complete rewrite of the backend () to interface with Supabase's PostgreSQL database for all data persistence and authentication.

Key accomplishments during this phase include:
-   **Backend Migration**: Removal of all MongoDB dependencies and their replacement with the Supabase Python client.
-   **Database Schema**: Definition of  and  tables with Row Level Security (RLS) policies in .
-   **Credential Management**: Updated  and  files with new Supabase credentials, and created  for secure storage.
-   **Authentication System**: Full implementation of user login/signup forms, JWT verification, and user session management. This involved creating new frontend files like , , and .
-   **Beautiful Auth UI**: The login and signup pages were meticulously designed to align with the Neo Design System, featuring glasmorphic elements, consistent branding ( title in blue), and responsive design.
-   **Conditional Email Confirmation**: The frontend was updated to handle situations where email confirmation is enabled/disabled on Supabase, and the user was provided explicit steps to disable it for easier testing.

The application now features a robust, fully integrated Supabase backend handling both authentication and data, complemented by a visually stunning and brand-consistent authentication frontend. The system is set up to auto-create database tables upon the first user signup.

The very last user request was to initiate the **Interview Flow** integration. The AI engineer has acknowledged this request and stated the plan to adapt it to the current React + FastAPI + Supabase architecture, making an initial edit to start the integration process.
