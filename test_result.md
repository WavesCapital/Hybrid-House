# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Backend: Added emergentintegrations library, created interview endpoints (/api/interview/start, /api/interview/chat, /api/interview/session/{id}), implemented session management with auto-save, OpenAI streaming responses, completion detection, and webhook trigger for score computation. Frontend: Created InterviewFlow component with chat interface, progress bar (2 questions for Alpha), auto-save functionality, skip functionality, and completion handling. Routing: Updated App.js to make interview flow mandatory (root path), moved paste profile to /paste URL. Database: Created comprehensive schema with RLS policies. Issue: Tables need manual creation in Supabase dashboard as automatic creation API failed. Ready for manual table creation and testing."

    message: "‚ùå CRITICAL OPENAI RESPONSES API ISSUE FOUND: Comprehensive testing (14/15 tests passed) reveals that while the OpenAI Responses API integration is configured correctly, there's a critical issue preventing actual API calls from working. Backend logs show OpenAI API calls failing with 400 error: 'Unknown parameter: input[0].timestamp'. The fix mentioned in the review request is incomplete - timestamp fields are still being included in OpenAI API requests despite filtering code being present. All other components are working perfectly: API connectivity ‚úÖ, system health ‚úÖ, database accessibility ‚úÖ, JWT authentication ‚úÖ, interview endpoints protection ‚úÖ, GPT-4.1 configuration ‚úÖ, Alpha version system message ‚úÖ. The system is ready for use except for this timestamp parameter issue that causes 500 errors on interview chat requests. This needs immediate attention to complete the OpenAI Responses API implementation."

    message: "‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES & REDIRECT IMPLEMENTED: Fixed major issues and restored original design flow. Backend: 1) Fixed duplicate message bug by restructuring message handling to prevent race conditions - now updates database only after successful OpenAI response, 2) Implemented exact user-specified system message for Kendall Toole personality. Frontend: 3) Fixed React rendering error in score display by properly handling complex score objects, 4) Removed inline score display from InterviewFlow and redirected to original AthleteProfile page (/paste) as requested by user. System now: follows exact system message, prevents duplicate messages, shows original beautiful score page, and maintains all existing functionality.
